#===============================================================================
# To do
#===============================================================================

The game records, for each species, how many have been caught or defeated
(counts both wild and trainer battles), and the shiny chance increases for that
species because of this. This value is also shown in the Pokédex entry screen.

Some moves have changed properties/effects:
- Rapid Spin now raises the user's Speed by 1 stage (100% additional effect
  chance).
- Howl's target changed to UserAndAllies, and is now a sound move. It is now
  blocked by Soundproof (I don't know if it should be checking the allies for
  pbImmunityByAbility, but leaning towards yes; will Volt Absorb block an
  Electrified Howl?). Needs a new function code, since it now affects targets
  rather than the user.
- Teleport switches the user out. If the user is a wild Pokémon, ends the battle
  instead.
- Curse's Ghost effect now targets a random foe (don't know if it can be non-
  adjacent); the target cannot be chosen by the player (it appears to target the
  user).
- Look at the moves Nature Power turns into.
- Healing Wish's effect and Lunar Dance's effect are no longer used up if a
  Pokémon that switches to the targeted position can't make use of it. Each
  position can only have one of each effect applied at once.
- Multiple Quashed Pokémon now move in order from fastest to slowest, rather
  than the order in which they were Quashed.
- Parting Shot is able to make the user switch out if its effect is redirected
  by Mirror Armor. Throat Spray is triggered and applies before the switch.
- Terrains have altered/additional effects.
- Double Iron Bash no longer has a different effect if the target is Minimized.

Some abilities have changed effects:
- Oblivious, Own Tempo, Inner Focus and Scrappy now block Intimidate.
- Intimidate now triggers Rattled.
- If Unburden is negated by Neutralizing Gas, Unburden's effect stops applying.
  If Neutralizing Gas then leaves the field, Unburden's boost returns.
- If another Pokémon faints before a Pokémon with Analytic makes its move,
  Analytic calculates whether it would have moved before or after the fainted
  Pokémon. In Gen 8, speed- and priority-modifying effects aren't considered,
  but in earlier Gens they are.
- Disguise now reduces the damage taken to 1/8, rather than to 0.

Some items have changed properties/effects:
- Zygarde Cube now changes a Zygarde's ability.
- Ability Capsule/Ability Patch should fail if used on Zygarde.
- If Leppa Berry is forced to be consumed, it will first try to work on a move
  with 0 PP left (preferring the earliest such move in the list of moves), and
  failing that, the earliest move in the list of moves which has any PP missing
  (no matter how much).
- Ensure that Choice items cause different moves to fail (without subtracting
  PP) if they were forced to be used by Instruct/Dancer.
- Iron Ball shouldn't modify the effectiveness of Ground moves against a Flying
  holder if the holder is grounded by another effect that isn't Iron Ball.

Other notes:
- In Gen 7+, Shaymin/Hoopa revert their form when withdrawn from storage rather
  than when deposited. It still also reverts under other conditions. Shaymin
  reverts its form when deposited in the Day Care (all Gens).
- Look at Sweet Scent's out of battle effect, namely whether it should try to
  cause a horde battle (and what does that mean in Essentials?).
- Maybe have multiple sets of Pickup items for multiple Gens.
- Dive Ball should have an increased catch rate if surfing or fishing(?). Nah.
- Add a newer type of berry tree mechanics? Have a separate setting that
  prevents deterioration?
- If a battle ends because of Rocky Helmet damage, the side that the Rocky
  Helmet holder is on should lose (Gen 7+) or win (Gen 6-).
- Maybe the N-Solarizer/N-Lunarizer/that other fusion item that changes
  descriptions should actually be two items each (one that combines, one that
  splits) and they alternate upon use. No reasonable game would have multiple
  sets of Pokémon to fuse at once, so allowing just one of each fusion at a time
  is probably fine.

Can use Fly from within the Town Map if possible. (Good QoL, add if possible.)

Make example event that combines the Gen 8 fossils.

New evolution methods:
- Galarian Farfetch'd: performing 3 critical hits in a single battle.

Add AI for new moves/items/abilities.

Zacian/Zamazenta need code that changes their movesets upon entering/leaving
battle. Can't use "onSetForm" since that's called after the battler is
initialized and pbOnEnteringBattle doesn't have access to the battler (could
change this).

#===============================================================================
# Low priority or ignorable
#===============================================================================

Marks, which are symbols randomly given to wild Pokémon which append a title to
its name when sent out in battle. A Pokémon can only have 0 or 1 marks. The
title can be toggled. Ribbons also provide a title, and can similarly be
toggled. (Probably don't bother implementing.)

Bicycle that can work on water.

Town Map added to the pause menu. (Don't bother adding.)

Remote access to storage boxes. See the Pokémon Box Link item.

New evolution methods:
- Milcery: spinning while holding an item. (Doesn't suit our control scheme.
           We're not adding a way to easily spin on the spot just for this, cf.
           not having to turn your computer upside-down to evolve Inkay.)
- Galarian Yamask: going to a particular spot after a battle in which it lost
                   49+ HP from a single attack and hasn't fainted since then;
                   healing doesn't affect this. (Utter nonsense, find a better
                   way.)

I think there are some alternate forms which don't have a hidden ability while
their base forms do. I don't think the compiler supports this, and instead
treats Abilities and HiddenAbilities separately. Can work around this by setting
HiddenAbilities to be the same as Abilities. I'm not too happy with this.

#===============================================================================
# Implemented
#===============================================================================

Pokémon sent to storage aren't healed - see Settings::HEAL_STORED_POKEMON.

Super shininess. Only difference is an alternate shiny common animation with
square sparkles; a mon is super shiny if the calculated number that is compared
to Settings::SHINY_POKEMON_CHANCE is exactly 0 - see Settings::SUPER_SHINY.

Can now give a Rare Candy to a max level Pokémon, which will trigger its
evolution (presumably the item isn't consumed if it can't at least try to evolve
it) - see Settings::RARE_CANDY_USABLE_AT_MAX_LEVEL.

In Gen 8+, a taught TR should be added to the Pokémon's first_moves array. This
is done regardless of Generation, and doesn't need to be limited to Gen 8+.

New evolution methods:
- Kubfu (triggered by an event; Kubfu's form can be set beforehand by the event,
  so don't worry about the multiple forms it can evolve into)

Escape Rope's code now supports both consumable and non-consumable versions,
depending on whether it is a key item. All it needs is a proper definition in
items.txt.

- Multi-Attack's power changed to 120.
- Rapid Spin's power changed to 50.
- Vice Grip renamed to Vise Grip.
- King's Rock/Razor Fang should probably stop using a flag to determine if a
  move is boosted by it, and instead check def flinchingMove?.
- Moveset changes.
- Some (12) existing species changed egg groups:
      Ralts, Kirlia, Gardevoir, and Gallade: Amorphous to Humanlike/Amorphous
      Trapinch, Vibrava, and Flygon: Bug to Bug/Dragon
      Hawlucha: Human-Like to Flying/Humanlike
      Bergmite and Avalugg: Monster to Monster/Mineral
      Noibat and Noivern: Flying to Flying/Dragon
- Aegislash's stats changed.
- Koffing/Weezing gained new abilities.
- Vice Grip becomes Vise Grip.
- Some items change names (Stick -> Leek, Bicycle -> Bike in Gen 6+, etc.). Only
  Stick changed.
- Changes to evolutions due to removal of moss rock/ice rock/magnetic field.
- Form differences.
